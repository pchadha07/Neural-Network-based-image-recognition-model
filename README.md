# Neural-Network-based-image-recognition-model
Neural network layers based model was build for recognising gestures performed by people. This model can be used for gesture recognisation applications that can use the models input and decide further course of action. 
The Final model is based on CNN3D architecture and consists of layers: Three CNN3D layers of sizes 32, 64 and 64. Followed by flatten and a fully connected layer. The fully connected
layer is a Dense layer based on RELU function and is of size 512. The final layer is Softmax based layer to provide the output, 'images:correct gesture tag:image number'
